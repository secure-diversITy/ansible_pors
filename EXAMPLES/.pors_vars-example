# USER VARIABLES for Playbooks-On-Rails for Splunk (PORS)
##########################################################
#
# all listed exports showing the DEFAULT used in PORS. 
# Outcomment them only when you want to change anything (also see: NOTE).
#
# Upgrading PORS will NOT touch this file so this is the ONLY safe way to ensure
# a newer PORS version will not overwrite your settings.
#
# NOTE:
# when referring to another variable the "other" variable must be declared here as
# well.
# Example:
# export ADIR=/my/path/${WHATEVER}/here/
# --> requires ${WHATEVER} to be set before
#
# INSTALL:
# $> cp .pors_vars-example ${HOME}/.pors/vars
